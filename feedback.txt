Overall the student made a good attempt to evaluate a range of RL models via three different games. The student is very self motivated to the work and has managed the project very well. The student clearly demonstrates both initiative and the ability to answer key questions set out.
However, The results of the RL models are a bit below the expectations in some of the experiments. The writing could be much clearer to help the reader understand the significance of tables, values and graphs presented. It would be helpful to see more thorough conclusions based on the work undertaken. The project here achieves many of the project goals, but much scope for further improvement including further optimisation and improvement of clarity of the work throughout.
